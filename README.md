# 1 Day 1 Project Challenge

Inspired by [Florin Pop](https://github.com/florinpop17)'s [100 days 100 projects challenge](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects/).

#### Nov 29, 2020
This is like a trial for me. I don't know how long I'll be able to keep up with this challenge, but my goal for now is 7 days 7 projects.

## Rules
These rules are from the original 100days 100 projects challenge with a bit of a tweak.

1. create a project per day
2. the project could be an app, a component, a design (CSS), a website, a game, a library, etc
3. you can pick any programming language you like
4. you can use any libraries or frameworks
5. the project must be done and pushed to GitHub by 11:59 PM

| Day | Name | Description | Repository |
